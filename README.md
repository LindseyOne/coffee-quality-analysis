Coffee quality analysis/visualizations
======================================

This repository contains a toy analysis/visualizations of the [coffee-quality-database](https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database).
Some of the most interesting visualizations are in the `gfx` directory, and the `plots.r` file contains code used for generating these plots.
